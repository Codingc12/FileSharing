  "description": "File Sharing API Requirements 1. Upload Endpoint: POST /files/upload Features: Accepts single/multiple files. Supports large file uploads with chunked/multipart requests. Validate file size and type (configurable limits). Store file metadata (name, size, type, hash, owner, timestamp). Return a unique file_id for each uploaded file. 2. Download Endpoint: GET /files/{file_id}/download Features: Secure download with authentication & authorization checks. Support range requests (resume downloads). Optional: allow download by filename. Return correct Content-Type and headers. 3. File Sharing through Mail Endpoint: POST /files/{file_id}/share/mail Features: Input: list of email addresses, permission type (view/edit). Generate secure access tokens/links embedded in mail. Email service integration (SMTP or external API like SendGrid). Optional expiration date for shared access. Notify sender when file is successfully shared. 4. File Sharing through Link Endpoint: POST /files/{file_id}/share/link Features: Generate a shareable link with optional parameters: Expiry time (e.g., valid for 24h, 7 days). Access type (view-only / download / edit). Password-protected links. Endpoint to revoke link: DELETE /share-links/{link_id}. Analytics (optional): track number of downloads/opens. ⚙️ Non-functional requirements (important for API design): Authentication: OAuth2 / JWT. Authorization: Role- and permission-based (owner, editor, viewer). Security: Encrypted storage (at rest & in transit), signed URLs. Scalability: Handle large files and concurrent users. Logging & audit trails for file access/sharing events.",
